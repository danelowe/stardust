# Stardust

A GitHub repository bookmark manager that solves two core problems for developers:

1. **Knowing which bookmarked repos are still worth using** (health monitoring)
2. **Discovering better alternatives as they emerge** (trending similar repos)

This transforms passive bookmarking into an active learning and discovery tool that keeps developers current with the
ecosystem.
